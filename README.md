# Python-challenge
This repository contains a homework assignment for the Python module of U of O data class, cohort Fall/Winter 2020.
There are two portions to this homework:
1. The first (PyBank) analyzes a mock dataset of company financial records, and ultimately quantifies several financial metrics which measure company profits over time.
2. The second (PyPoll) analyzes mock election data, to quantify how many candidates participated in the election, how many votes each candidate recieved, and who won the election.
